# Why Prototype Routing Transformers (PRT) Could Redefine Stock Prediction and Beyond

Traditional transformers have been revolutionary for sequential data, but **financial time series** are unique: highly noisy, non-linear, and with rare patterns. Standard transformers often struggle to capture these efficiently.

**Enter Prototype Routing Transformers (PRT).** Instead of treating all sequences equally, PRT **learns representative patterns (prototypes)** and routes sequences through them, combining **accuracy, robustness, and interpretability**. Pioneering work by researchers like **Jiajie Yang** has shown the power of prototype-based routing in sequential models.

## Project Overview

I developed a **stock prediction system using PRT** to forecast prices from a **user-specified date**.  

### Models Used
- **Base Transformer (Seq2Seq)** – for comparison  
- **Prototype Routing Transformer (PRT)** – for improved pattern recognition  

### Libraries & Tools
- `PyTorch` – modeling  
- `NumPy`, `Pandas` – data processing  
- `scikit-learn` – normalization and metrics  
- `yfinance` – historical stock data  
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` – visualizations  

### Methodology
1. Preprocessed stock data with technical indicators  
2. Scaled sequences using **MinMaxScaler**  
3. Generated predictions for **multiple tickers** from a user-input date  
4. Compared PRT predictions with a standard transformer using **MSE**  
5. Visualized learned prototypes via **t-SNE plots**, showing which trends influenced predictions  

### Key Features
- Predictions are **interpretable**: each forecast linked to prototype patterns  
- Robust to noisy and volatile markets  
- Flexible for other sequential tasks (energy, healthcare, logistics)

## Why PRT Over Standard Transformers
- **Better Pattern Recognition:** References learned prototypes instead of relying solely on raw sequences  
- **Explainability:** Analysts can trace forecasts to specific patterns  
- **Stability:** Reduces overfitting to market noise  
- **Broader Applications:** Any time-series forecasting problem benefits from prototypes

## Results
- **Base Transformer MSE:** 0.00120  
- **PRT Transformer MSE:** 0.00067 (~44% improvement!)  
- Visualizations showed prototypes capture **key market trends**  
- Predictions can start from **any user-specified date**, making the system flexible and practical

This project is a step towards **AI-powered, interpretable financial analysis**, helping analysts and traders **make data-backed decisions with confidence**.

**Credits:** Inspired by research by **Jiajie Yang** on Prototype Routing Transformers.

### Discussion Points
- Where else could prototype-based sequence models be applied?  
- How do you think explainable forecasting will change trading strategies?
